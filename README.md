# BizHack 2020 Team 28

## Project Ideas
Our idea originated from a discussion of how we could find people who want to work on a project together, but each other with different skills. As we know, learning is by doing. We can absorb and learn the knowledge or technology more quickly if we can implement it to the projects. However, for most students and people who just make for personal interests, they might find hard to find a teammate that has the specific skill that they need. Thus, we create the app to create the platform for people who want to make projects, and connect them together.

### Feature
- Allow user choose beginner, intermediate and advance level of project based on their skill level
- User could join a team if they match the skill for the project
- Users will receive feedback after the project which other people could review their performance
- Set up the project duration, size, and contents
